Tool for euclidean geometry aware of logic

## Dependencies
+ Python3
+ pycairo
+ pyGtk3

## Controls
(the GUI is highly provisional so far)
+ 'f' -- Draw point
+ 'd' -- Draw dependent point (on a line or on a circle)
+ 'm' -- Move point
+ 'l' -- line
+ 'c' -- circle
+ 'C' -- compass
+ 'x' -- intersection of two lines
+ 'X' -- the intersection of two clines further from a third point
+ '/' -- midpoint
+ '1' -- a point on circle has the radius distnce from its center
+ '2' -- if a point has a radius distance from a center of a circle, it lies on it
+ '3' -- if two triangles are equally oriented and has equally long sides, they have equal angles
+ Backspace -- Go one step backwards in the construction
+ Change in the left panel of radio-buttons -- Use a scripted tool (their code is mostly in macros.gl)
+ Shift+Click -- chenge ambiguous object
