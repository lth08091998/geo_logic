# geo_logic
Tool for euclidean geometry aware of logic

## Dependencies
+ Python3
+ pycairo
+ pyGtk3

## Controls
(the GUI is highly provisional so far)
+ 'x' -- Point (free point / intersection / midpoint / midpoint_arc / center / foot)
+ 'l' -- Line (line / free line / parallel line)
+ 't' -- Perpline (perpendicular bisector / perpendicular line)
+ 'c' -- Circle (circle / compass / free circle)
+ 'o' -- Circumcircle (free circle passing, diacircle, circumcircle)
+ '1' -- a point on circle has the radius distnce from its center
+ '2' -- if a point has a radius distance from a center of a circle, it lies on it
+ '3' -- if two triangles are equally oriented and has equally long sides, they have equal angles
+ Backspace -- Go one step backwards in the construction
+ Change in the left panel of radio-buttons -- Use a scripted tool (their code is mostly in macros.gl)
+ Shift+Click -- change ambiguous object
+ 'm' -- Move
+ 'h' -- Move
+ Ctrl+O -- open file
+ Ctrl+S -- save
+ Ctrl+Shift+S -- save as
