* simple logic changes
  * unit and unit circle (a prime number)
  * midpoint as a basic operation

* numerical model inside logic
  * fraction elimination of angles
    + numerical checking
    -> angle_div not needed
  * automatically applied uniqueness
    * lines
    * circles
    * intersections (even of circles)
      * even when the circle is not explicitely specified
  * automatically applied other facts, e.g.:
    * radius_dist
    * point_on_line_bisector
  * proof of universality of a construction

* visualisation of some facts
  * lies_on
  * equal angles
    * right angle (perpendicular)
    * parallel
* selection of ambiguous (numerically equivalent) object
* Numerical models outside GUI
  * Lemma proven for a special case can be used in general
    * possible cheating:
      * equilateral_aa -> ss can be used
        for proving that C is a midpoint of AB, if A,B,C are collinear
	and it is checked numerically
  * GUI <-> file (save / load)
  * in composite tools: distinguish steps that
    * can fail (assumptions)
    * that can numerically fail (proof steps)
    * and that should not fail (conclusions)
* gamification -- problem format, given goal, detection of solution
