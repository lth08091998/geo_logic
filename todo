* visualisation of some facts
  * lies_on
  * equal angles
    * right angle (perpendicular)
    * parallel
* selection of ambiguous (numerically equivalent) object
* Numerical models outside GUI
  * Lemma proven for a special case can be used in general
  * GUI <-> file (save / load)
  * in composite tools: distinguish steps that
    * can fail (assumptions)
    * that can numerically fail (proof steps)
    * and that should not fail (conclusions)
* automatically applied facts: line_uq, radius_dist, primarily *_uq
* gamification -- problem format, given goal, detection of solution
